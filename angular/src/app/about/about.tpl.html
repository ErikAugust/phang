    The Elevator Pitch
    <small>For the lazy and impatient.</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web
    development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
    web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
    have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
    slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
    to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust
    build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    Because my team and I make web apps, and 
    last year AngularJS became our client-side framework of choice. We start
    websites the same way every time: create a directory structure, copy and
    ever-so-slightly tweak some config files from an older project, and yada
    yada, etc., and so on and so forth. Why are we repeating ourselves? We wanted a starting point; a set of
    best practices that we could identify our projects as embodying and a set of
    time-saving wonderfulness, because time is money.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other similar projects out there, but none of them suited our
    needs. Some are awesome but were just too much, existing more as reference
    implementations, when we really just wanted a kickstarter. Others were just
    too little, with puny build systems and unscalable architectures.  So we
    designed <code>ng-boilerplate</code> to be just right.
  </p>

  <h2>What ng-boilerplate Is Not</h2>

  <p>
    This is not an example of an AngularJS app. This is a kickstarter. If
    you're looking for an example of what a complete, non-trivial AngularJS app
    that does something real looks like, complete with a REST backend and
    authentication and authorization, then take a look at <code><a
        href="https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app/">angular-app</a></code>, 
    which does just that, and does it well.
  </p>

  <h1 class="page-header">
    So What's Included?
    <small>I'll try to be more specific than "awesomeness".</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    This section is just a quick introduction to all the junk that comes
    pre-packaged with <code>ng-boilerplate</code>. For information on how to
    use it, see the <a
      href="https://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate#readme">project page</a> at
    GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>
    The high-altitude view is that the base project includes 
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
    styles to quickly produce slick-looking responsive web sites and apps. It also
    includes <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap">UI Bootstrap</a>,
    a collection of native AngularJS directives based on the aforementioned
    templates and styles. It also includes <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>,
    a wicked-cool collection of font-based icons that work swimmingly with all
    manner of web projects; in fact, all images on the site are actually font-
    based icons from Font Awesome. Neat! Lastly, this also includes
    <a href="http://joshdmiller.github.com/angular-placeholders">Angular Placeholders</a>,
    a set of pure AngularJS directives to do client-side placeholder images and
    text to make mocking user interfaces super easy.
  </p>

  <p>
    And, of course, <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is built on <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>,
    by the far the best JavaScript framework out there! But if you don't know
    that already, then how did you get here? Well, no matter - just drink the
    Kool Aid. Do it. You know you want to.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>

  <p>
    You already know about this, right? If not, <a
      href="http://getbootstrap.com">hop on over</a> and check it out; it's
    pretty sweet. Anyway, all that wonderful stylistic goodness comes built in.
    The LESS files are available for you to import in your main stylesheet as
    needed - no excess, no waste. There is also a dedicated place to override
    variables and mixins to suit your specific needs, so updating to the latest
    version of Bootstrap is as simple as: 
  </p>

  <pre>$ cd vendor/twitter-bootstrap<br />$ git pull origin master</pre>

  <p>
    Boom! And victory is ours.
  </p>

  <h2>UI Bootstrap</h2>

  <p>
    What's better than Bootstrap styles? Bootstrap directives!  The fantastic <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap">UI Bootstrap</a>
    library contains a set of native AngularJS directives that are endlessly
    extensible. You get the tabs, the tooltips, the accordions. You get your
    carousel, your modals, your pagination. And <i>more</i>.
    How about a quick demo? 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="dropdown">
      <a class="btn dropdown-toggle">
        Click me!
      </a>
      <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li ng-repeat="choice in dropdownDemoItems">
          <a>{{choice}}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Oh, and don't include jQuery;  
    you don't need it.
    This is better.
    Don't be one of those people. <sup>*</sup>
  </p>

  <p><small><sup>*</sup> Yes, there are exceptions.</small></p>

  <h2>Font Awesome</h2>

  <p>
    Font Awesome has earned its label. It's a set of open (!) icons that come
    distributed as a font (!) for super-easy, lightweight use. Font Awesome 
    works really well with Twitter Bootstrap, and so fits right in here.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is not a single image on this site. All of the little images and icons 
    are drawn through Font Awesome! All it takes is a little class:
  </p>

  <pre>&lt;i class="icon-flag"&gt;&lt/i&gt</pre>

  <p>
    And you get one of these: <i class="icon-flag"> </i>. Neat!
  </p>

  <h2>Placeholders</h2>

  <p>
    Angular Placeholders is a simple library for mocking up text and images. You
    can automatically throw around some "lorem ipsum" text:
  </p>

  <pre>&lt;p ph-txt="3s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    Which gives you this:
  </p>

  <div class="pre">
    &lt;p&gt;
    <p ph-txt="3s"></p>
    &lt;/p&gt;
  </div>

  <p>
    Even more exciting, you can also create placeholder images, entirely 
    client-side! For example, this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-polaroid" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-rounded" /&gt;
&lt;img ph-img="50x50" class="img-circle" /&gt;</pre>

  <p>
    Gives you this:
  </p>

  <div>
    <img ph-img="50x50" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-polaroid" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-rounded" />
    <img ph-img="50x50" class="img-circle" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Which is awesome.
  </p>

  <h1 class="page-header">
    The Roadmap
    <small>Really? What more could you want?</small>
  </h1>

  <p>
    This is a project that is <i>not</i> broad in scope, so there's not really
    much of a wish list here. But I would like to see a couple of things:
  </p>

  <p>
    I'd like it to be a little simpler. I want this to be a universal starting
    point. If someone is starting a new AngularJS project, she should be able to
    clone, merge, or download its source and immediately start doing what she
    needs without renaming a bunch of files and methods or deleting spare parts
    ... like this page. This works for a first release, but I just think there
    is a little too much here right now.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'd also like to see a simple generator. Nothing like <a href="yeoman.io">
    Yeoman</a>, as there already is one of those, but just something that
    says "I want Bootstrap but not Font Awesome and my app is called 'coolApp'.
    Gimme." Perhaps a custom download builder like UI Bootstrap
    has. Like that. Then again, perhaps some Yeoman generators wouldn't be out
    of line. I don't know. What do you think?
  </p>

  <p>
    Naturally, I am open to all manner of ideas and suggestions. See the "Can I
    Help?" section below.
  </p>

  <h2>The Tactical To Do List</h2>

  <p>
    There isn't much of a demonstration of UI Bootstrap. I don't want to pollute
    the code with a demo for demo's sake, but I feel we should showcase it in
    <i>some</i> way.
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>ng-boilerplate</code> should include end-to-end tests. This should
    happen soon. I just haven't had the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, this site should be prettier, but I'm no web designer. Throw me a
    bone here, people!
  </p>

  <h2>Can I Help?</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, please!
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an opinionated kickstarter, but the opinions are fluid and
    evidence-based. Don't like the way I did something? Think you know of a
    better way? Have an idea to make this more useful? Let me know! You can
    contact me through all the usual channels or you can open an issue on the
    GitHub page. If you're feeling ambitious, you can even submit a pull
    request - how thoughtful of you!
  </p>

  <p>
    So join the team! We're good people.
